# Week 10 - Beyond Linear Models


## Linear models can have several limitations. Explain why the following might be a problem:

- Nonlinearity
- Correlated error tests
- Heteroscedasticity
- Outliers
- High leverage points
- Collinearity
- High dimensions

## We have seen some strategies to deal with high dimensions.

- What is PCA regression? 
- What is kernel regression?

# Qualitative features
- How do you deal with qualitative features?
- Optional: what is the difference between dummy-ing variable and one-hot-encoders?

## Moving foward

- What are step functions and basis functions?
- How would we remove the additive assumption of linear progression? 
- What is the difference between main and interaction effects?
- What is the hierarchical principle?
- What is polynomial regression?
- What is piecewise polynomial and splines?
- What is smoothing splines?
- What is non parametric logistic regression?
- What are general additive models?
- How does a linear model relate to shallow neural networks?
